# 🔢 Day 11: 2D Arrays | HackerRank 30 Days of Code

     This repository contains the Python solution for Day 11 of the HackerRank 30 Days of Code challenge, which focuses on 2D arrays and pattern-based computation using the hourglass sum concept.

## 🚀 Challenge Summary

    Given a 6x6 2D array of integers, the task is to find the maximum sum of any hourglass formed in the matrix.

## 📝 Problem Statement

    An hourglass in a 2D array is defined as a subset of values with the following pattern:

a b c

  d
  
e f g

## Steps:

-Read a 6x6 2D integer array.

-Calculate the sum of all possible hourglasses.

-Output the maximum hourglass sum.

## ✅ Constraints

Each integer in the 2D array is in the inclusive range -9 to 9.

## 🔢 Sample Input

1 1 1 0 0 0

0 1 0 0 0 0

1 1 1 0 0 0

0 0 2 4 4 0

0 0 0 2 0 0

0 0 1 2 4 0

## ✅ Sample Output

19

## 💡 Explanation

-There are 16 hourglasses in a 6x6 matrix. 

-The code calculates each hourglass sum and tracks the maximum one.

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced 

-2D array traversal

-Pattern recognition

-Nested loops

-Tracking maximum values

-Efficient data processing

## 🛠️ How to Run

Option 1: With input file Create a file named input.txt with the required input and run: python3 2d_arrays.py < input.txt

Option 2: Manual input Just run: python3 2d_arrays.py
